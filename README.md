PyCitySchools
Please note that I worked with both Joel Ortega and Moises Contreras from our class for trouble shooting and some brainstorming where needed.

For this homework, I acted as the new Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district. In this capacity, I helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

For my first task, I was asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I waS given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Specifically, we have 
#District Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

    Total number of unique schools

    Total students

    Total budget

    Average math score

    Average reading score

    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

    School name

    School type

    Total students

    Total school budget

    Per student budget

    Average math score

    Average reading score

    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
